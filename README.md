# Feature Engineering for an Expected Assists Model 

This was originally part of a proof of concept for feature engineering and data manipulation using SQL and R. 

Given certain pass and player location data for soccer, I needed to engineer features that best predict whether a pass results in an assist.
I did so using RSQLite on a Quarto Notebook interface, knitting to HTML for easier distribution.

Each feature is backed up by tactical analyses of *why* it was included, and how it could be interpreted.
